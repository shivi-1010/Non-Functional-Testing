# Non-Functional Testing

This repository showcases **hands-on non-functional testing work** focused on validating the quality attributes of software systems, including **performance, load, stress, reliability, availability, and environment readiness**.

---

## What This Repository Includes

### Performance, Load & Stress Testing
- Designed and executed **load, stress, and reliability tests** using both:
  - Custom **Python multithreaded scripts**
  - **Locust-based performance testing**
- Simulated concurrent users, request bursts, and sustained traffic
- Measured response time, throughput, error rates, and system stability
- Identified system limits and performance bottlenecks

### Reliability & Stability Testing
- Performed **long-running reliability tests** to evaluate system behavior under continuous load
- Simulated real user wait times and usage patterns
- Analyzed consistency of response times and failure patterns

### User Behavior Simulation
- Implemented **user journey simulations** (login and navigation flows)
- Captured detailed request metrics including status codes, response size, and latency
- Exported structured results for further analysis

### Environment Automation & Validation
- Automated **environment setup** using shell scripts and Vagrant
- Implemented:
  - Pre-installation system checks (CPU, RAM, disk)
  - Automated package installation
  - Post-installation validation of services and versions
- Ensured test environments met required non-functional criteria before execution

### Test Reporting & Analysis
- Generated **HTML performance reports** for load, stress, and reliability testing
- Compared results across different user loads
- Documented findings and improvement recommendations in structured reports
